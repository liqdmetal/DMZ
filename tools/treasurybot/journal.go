// The journal closes the crash window between ClaimFees and Deposit, per asset. founders.bas v2 keeps one reward pool
// per asset, and a fee is paid to the passes in the asset it was taken in (the operator's ruling of 2026-09-13). A
// market's ClaimFees sends the treasury its fees in two legs, fd in the market's quote and fa in its asset, and each
// leg is owed to the pass at `share` bps in that same asset. Every claim is recorded before it is sent and every
// deposit before it is sent; on start the bot reconciles each open record against the chain and finishes what it
// started. Written with fsync + rename; a corrupt journal stops the bot.
//
// What counts as done is what the contracts counted, not what the wallet returned:
//   - A claim is proven by the market's cumulative fc counter, which only ClaimFees moves, by the quote leg it sends.
//     The quote units owed are that growth. So a claim is sent only when the quote leg holds something (fd > 0): with
//     nothing in it, nothing on chain could prove the claim ran.
//   - The asset leg has no counter. It is counted at the fa read just before the send, which the claim moved at least:
//     fa only grows until a ClaimFees sends all of it to the treasury, whoever calls it. Asset-leg fees that arrive
//     between that read and the claim's execution reach the treasury uncounted. That is at most the fees of the blocks
//     the claim waits for, and it errs toward the treasury, never toward a deposit the claims did not earn.
//   - A deposit is closed only once the pass's per-asset counter ad_<i> grew by its units. ad_0 also counts market
//     fees, and anyone may deposit, so the test is "grew by at least".
//
// A transaction that was included but not executed moves none of these counters.
//
// While no pass is registered, v2 refuses every Deposit. The bot then holds what it owes in Owed and deposits it once a
// pass registers, in the first deposit of each asset (the operator's ruling of 2026-09-13).
