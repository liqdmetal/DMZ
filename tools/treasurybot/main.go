// treasurybot is the wallet-side step the Founders Pass v2 needs: a DERO contract cannot pay another contract, so the
// protocol treasury claims its fees from every listed market (pool.bas and launch.bas ClaimFees: fd in the market's
// quote, fa in its asset) and deposits the promised share of each asset into the Founders Pass with v2's
// Deposit(asset), in the asset the fee was taken in, never converted to DERO. Each registered position then claims
// its part with Claim(p, i, ka, kb), which anyone may send and which pays the position's owner; this bot pushes no
// payouts. Everything it does is public on chain (fc per market, ad_<i> per asset on the pass), so anyone can check
// the share is deposited. The bot makes every deposit; no contract forces it.
//
//	go run ./treasurybot -wallet 127.0.0.1:30002 [-config ../app/config.js] [-min-units 5000] [-interval 60s] [-once]
//
// The share is read from the pass contract (`share` bps, immutable), never from a flag. Amounts are integer atomic
// units of their own asset everywhere (C5): -min-units 5000 is 0.05 DERO on a DERO leg.
//
// While no pass is registered, founders.bas v2 refuses every Deposit. The bot then holds what it owes the passes in
// its journal and deposits it once a pass registers, in the first deposit of each asset (the operator's ruling of
// 2026-09-13; journal.go).
//
// The wallet's RPC login, when it asks for one, comes from VEIL_RPC_LOGIN (user:password), the variable netwallet
// starts it with. On a mainnet config the bot refuses, dry run included, before its first call when the variable is
// unset or when -wallet carries a login in its address (X-27).
//
// It makes no XMR or ZEC payment. The Monero and Zcash addresses a holder may store on the pass with SetXmr and
// SetZec are data only: nothing pays them, and the app only shows a holder their own. The wrapped wXMR and wZEC are
// DERO tokens, and their fees are claimed and deposited like any other asset's. (The XMR/ZEC payouts of bb1ee34
// shared a swap fee that the operator's ruling of 2026-09-15 removed with the atomic swaps.)
