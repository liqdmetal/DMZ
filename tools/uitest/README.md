# tools/uitest: the headless browser passes

`ui.mjs` drives the app in headless Chromium through Playwright against a running simulator: `run.sh` (the read-only
and wallet passes), `ui.mjs --mainnet` (the mainnet-shaped pass) and `tools/check.sh --ui`. `capture.mjs` and
`xswdprobe.mjs` are helpers.

`ui-vault.mjs` is the read-only WT-17 pass run by `ui.mjs` in the ordinary simulator mode. It sets the page's
wallet address to the owner of the configured vault's index 0, then checks that the Wrap screen renders the
attested deposit address and a withdrawal `#j` row, and that `D.burnOpened` accepts the exact Burn record and
rejects a wrong net amount. It signs nothing; it needs the simulator's vault and an attested index 0.

## The Playwright pin (MT-H03)

Playwright is not vendored. `PW_DIR` names a directory where it is installed, and the passes load it from there.
The version is pinned in `ui.mjs`:

| | Pinned | Recorded from |
|---|---|---|
| Playwright (`playwright`, `playwright-core`) | **1.62.0** | the install every recorded pass of 2026-09-11 used: `node_modules/playwright/package.json`; its `package-lock.json` gives integrity `sha512-Z14dG305…Sylw==` (playwright) and `sha512-nsNRyq0r…XljA==` (playwright-core) from registry.npmjs.org |
| Chromium | **151.0.7922.34**, Playwright browser revision 1234 (`chromium-1234`, `chromium_headless_shell-1234`) | `playwright-core/browsers.json` of 1.62.0 |
| Node | 22.10.0 used; not enforced | `node --version` |

At start `ui.mjs` prints the Playwright version and where it came from, then the Chromium build it launched:

```
• playwright 1.62.0 (pinned 1.62.0) from <playwright>
• browser: chromium 151.0.7922.34 (pinned 151.0.7922.34)
```

It exits 2 before opening a page when either differs from the pin. `--any-playwright` (or `PW_ANY=1`) runs it
anyway, and the two lines above then record what was used. A result from an unpinned run is not evidence for the
pinned one.

Setting up a pinned `PW_DIR`:

```
mkdir <playwright> && cd <playwright>
npm init -y && npm i --save-exact playwright@1.62.0
npx playwright install chromium          # fetches revision 1234; nothing else is needed
PW_DIR=<playwright> node <repo>/tools/uitest/ui.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8082/index.html .sim/ui-1
```

Keep that directory's `package-lock.json`: it holds the registry integrity hashes of the exact packages.

To move the pin, change `PLAYWRIGHT_PIN` and `CHROMIUM_PIN` in `ui.mjs` together. Take the new Chromium build from
`playwright-core/browsers.json`, and update the table above in the same commit.

`capture.mjs` loads Playwright the same way but does not check the pin. It is a screenshot helper, not a pass.
