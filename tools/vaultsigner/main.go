// vaultsigner is one federation signer for contracts/vault.bas v3. It watches a foreign chain for deposits to the
// attested per-index addresses, votes Mint after the confirmation and finality policy, derives and attests deposit
// addresses for new indexes, pays pending withdrawals through the foreign backend and votes Released. Run one per
// signer wallet; k of them must agree before the contract does anything.
//
//	go run ./vaultsigner -network simulator -backend sim -wallet 127.0.0.1:30003 -vault <scid> -sim ../research/crosschain/poc/sim-foreign.json [-once]
//
// Backends: `sim` reads and appends to a JSON file. It simulates a foreign chain, it does not observe one — a
// deposit in it is a line somebody typed and a release in it is a line this signer typed — so it is refused on
// every DERO network but the simulator. The real backends implement the same interface: zcash is built
// (transparent P2SH k-of-n, zcash_backend.go and ./zcashvault, -zcash-config) and monero is built (wallet-rpc,
// monero_backend.go and ./monerovault, -monero-config); solana is not.
// -backend has no default: which backend a signer is running is the operator's statement to make,
// not this tool's to assume. Release MUST be idempotent for a given j (look the payment up before paying):
// the signer records an intent before it pays and may call Release again after a crash.
//
// Exactly-once release: every withdrawal goes through a durable intent (paying -> paid -> voted) written with
// fsync + rename before the next step; the state file is loaded strictly and is bound to one vault.
//
// Every vote is proved by reading back the daemon's OWN vote key (<f>v_<scope>_<address> holds the choice that
// signer made), so a co-signer voting in the same block can never be mistaken for our own vote landing.
