Reads: the app never trusts a listing. For every SCID the factory names it fetches the code, hashes it, requires a
match with a shipped template (`config.js`), and requires the contract's treasury to equal the factory's. Trades in
the feed are the pool's own `t_<n>` records, written only when the trader passed `publish = 1`; nobody can insert a
trade they did not make, and unpublished trades leave no record beyond the reserve change.

Writes: gas estimate on the node → `transfer` through XSWD (the wallet prompts) → poll `DERO.GetTransaction`.
Fees are the estimate's `gasstorage` plus a small margin. Calls that pay the caller through `SIGNER()` go at ringsize
2 and so name the payer on chain; private mode uses the `…To` entrypoints, which pay a named address and go at
ringsize 16 (`app/app.js:99,191`). The estimate names the signer to the node only at ringsize 2 — naming it at 16 would
undo the ring (`app/app.js:115-117`). Every TELA DOC and the INDEX itself are installed at ringsize 2, so the INDEX
stays updatable (`tools/telainstall/main.go:232,249`).

No DMZ server: an optional Gnomon read cache is feature-flagged off and the app falls back to the DERO node.
The optional Solana NFT gallery is a browser-only exception to the single-node read path: it queries a user-selected
Solana JSON-RPC endpoint directly, checks the returned standard SPL/Token-2022 token accounts against their raw bytes,
checks mint supply and the canonical Metaplex metadata and edition accounts at finalized commitment, and labels the
result RPC-reported. It is not an independent light client; the endpoint can lie and learns the queried address. The
gallery does not sign transactions or fetch metadata documents or images.

## Why one contract per launch, with a built-in AMM
The DVM cannot call, read, install or fund other contracts (DECISIONS §1.2, §2). A launch therefore owns its whole
lifecycle: curve, graduation and the AMM are one contract, and the liquidity is literally unwithdrawable because no
entrypoint exists for it. `pool.bas` exists for assets that already exist on DERO.

## Placeholders — explicitly not built (RISKS R-8)
- **Tokenised equities / "stocks".** Would need a regulated issuer and an oracle; DERO has neither. A synthetic
  price-tracker is a derivative. If this is ever revisited it belongs in a separate contract family with its own
  legal basis, not in `launch.bas`.
- **Cross-chain assets (Solana / Base / …).** No trust-minimised bridge to DERO exists. The read-only Solana NFT
  gallery is not a bridge, ownership proof, marketplace or DERO asset. `contracts/vault.bas` is the research answer
  and is not one: a named k-of-n federation of bonded signers holds the foreign reserve and can
  steal or freeze it, and the contract only makes the DERO side honest and auditable. It is installed on the simulator
  only (`deploy/networks.json`), with `app/wrap.js` as its screen; the trust model, party by party, is in
  `research/wrapper/README.md`. The `asset` field of `pool.bas` is the only integration point a wrapped asset needs.
- **Fiat on-ramp.** Out of scope; wallets already handle DERO acquisition.

## Data growth and the indexer
`t_<n>` and `p_<n>` grow with activity and the app currently reads contracts with `variables:true`. When a contract's
variable set gets large, switch the app to `keysstring` ranges (already supported by `rpc.js`) or enable the Gnomon
cache in Settings. Neither changes any contract.

## Networks (2026-09-06)

The same contracts and app run on the simulator, a testnet and mainnet. `deploy/networks.json` records each
network's SCIDs, template hashes and TELA index; `tools/genconfig` renders `app/config.js` (development) or
`dist/<network>/` (one TELA install per network); `tools/telainstall`, `tools/netwallet` and `tools/vaultsigner` take
`-network`. The app checks the connected node's network name against its build and warns on a mismatch. The
testnet in this repo is a private chain (`deploy/README.md (Testnet)`): the vendored `derod` accepts a genesis transaction
from `DERO_PRIVATE_GENESIS_TX` so the owner account exists at genesis and can mine; everything else registers
through the normal proof-of-work registration.
