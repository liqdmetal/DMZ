// DMZ wrap.js — the wrapped-asset screen: deposit a foreign coin, hold a DERO asset backed one for one, burn it
// to withdraw. Everything here is read from the vault contract; nothing is assumed. The two numbers a user is
// most often surprised by — the minimum deposit and the height a withdrawal becomes payable — are published in
// the place the decision is made, because a rule you can see is a rule and a rule you cannot see is a trap.
//
// Honesty rules this screen follows:
//   - no SAFE badge and no green shield: the federation is named, counted and its bond is shown, and the fact
//     that k of them can move the reserve is stated in plain words on the screen, not in a linked document;
//   - Register and Burn call SIGNER(), which is real only at ring size 2, so the calling address is public. That
//     is said before the button, not after the transaction;
//   - amounts are foreign base units. The decimals come from the deployment record (vaultAsset.dec), never from
//     a guess, and when the record is missing the raw base units are shown as-is.
