// DMZ screens.js — Portfolio, Profile, Settings (with the security & privacy panel).
// Portfolio answers one question for a Monero or Zcash holder: what do I hold, in the asset I actually care
// about. So the wrapped assets lead — present or zero — DERO is named as gas rather than as a market, and token
// holdings are grouped by the quote they trade against, subtotalled inside each quote and never across them.
// There is no rate between XMR, ZEC and DERO here and there must never be an oracle, so a cross-currency total
// would be an invented number: where one used to be printed there is now a sentence saying why there is not.
// Profile separates what this address published from what the address itself gives away from what never leaves
// this browser. Settings is a technical panel: labelled sections, hairline rows, mono for machine strings.
